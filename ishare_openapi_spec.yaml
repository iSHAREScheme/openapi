  title: iSHARE API specifications
  description: >-
    These are the API specifications of iSHARE Scheme v2.2.

    These specifications describe the standardised identification,
    authentication and authorization mechanisms to be implemented by iSHARE
    participants. Depending on the role your organisation fulfils within the
    iSHARE Scheme, you need to provide an iSHARE API according to the
    specifications below.

    It is essential to understand that this page describes the generic API
    specifications for participants. The endpoints described are not actual
    functioning endpoints. For example, any Service Provider in iSHARE needs to
    implement the API endpoints as described in the Service Provider section,
    but his exact endpoints may vary. The /capabilities endpoint, which is
    required for every participant, displays the actual endpoints exposed under
    iSHARE for participants.

      summary: Retrieves iSHARE capabilities
      description: >-
        The /capabilities endpoint is required for every participant that
        provides services. The endpoint returns iSHARE capabilities (supported
        versions & optional features) of the iSHARE party. 


        The capabilities endpoint should only return the public endpoints if no
        access token is provided. If an access token is provided, the
        capabilities endpoint will also provide the restricted endpoints. A
        party may also have private endpoints, which are endpoints for their own
        internal organization, also known as endpoints that are implemented, but
        not to share with the others. These endpoints are not within the scope
        of iSHARE and should not be returned to other iSHARE parties.

      summary: Update claim information
      description: >-
        Used to partially update a specific claim of an iSHARE participant in the Participant 
        Registry. This flexible update mechanism allows updating any claim property using
        a key-value structure in the request body.
        
        The key represents the property path within the claim (using dot notation for 
        nested properties), and the value is the new value to set. Only the provided 
        fields will be updated, other fields remain unchanged.
        
        Examples of property paths:
        - "status" - Update claim status
        - "validFrom" - Update validity start time (ISO 8601 date-time)
        - "validUntil" - Update validity end time (ISO 8601 date-time)
        - "role.roleId" - Update role ID in role claim
        - "role.status" - Update role status
        - "role.loa" - Update level of assurance
        - "agreement.agreementId" - Update agreement ID
        - "agreement.status" - Update agreement status
        - "agreement.title" - Update agreement title
        - "additionalInfo.companyEmail" - Update company email in additional info
        
        The claim ID and type cannot be changed through this operation.

        Server response is an iSHARE signed JSON Web Token. Please refer to the
        models 'jwtHeader' and 'jwtPayloadClaimToken' which indicate what
        the decoded response will look like.

        headers. For convenience this documentation only defines the GET method.
        Parameters are undefined because they vary for each Service Provider due

        statefulnes, application functionality could be added and is out of

      type: object
      description: >-
        Schema for partial updates to a claim. This flexible schema allows updating
        any claim property by using a key-value structure. The key represents the
        property path within the claim, and the value is the new value to set.
        
        For nested properties, use dot notation (e.g., "frameworkRole.roleId").
        The claim type, registrarId and ID cannot be changed through this operation.
        
        Common claim properties that can be updated:
        - status: Claim status (active, inactive, suspended, revoked)
        - validFrom: ISO 8601 date-time when claim becomes valid
        - validUntil: ISO 8601 date-time when claim expires
        
        Type-specific properties can also be updated using the appropriate property paths.

        Note that claims cannot be deleted, but instead the status can be set to revoked or inactive.

        Because the claimId must be provided in the URL, only the properties of that 
        specific claim may be updated in one request.
